      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>
        Walter Hartwell White Sr., also known by his drug-lord alias Heisenberg,
        is the main character of the American crime drama television series
        Breaking Bad, portrayed by Bryan Cranston. Walter was a skilled chemist
        and co-founder of a technology firm before he accepted a buy-out from
        his partners. Walt became a high-school chemistry teacher in
        Albuquerque, and barely making ends meet with his family with wife
        Skyler (Anna Gunn) and son Walt Jr. (RJ Mitte). At the start of the
        series, the day after his 50th birthday, Walt is diagnosed with Stage
        III lung cancer. After this discovery, Walt resorts to manufacturing and
        selling methamphetamine with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron
        Paul), to ensure his family's financial security after his death. Due to
        his chemistry training and production route, Walt's "blue meth" is purer
        than any other on the market, and he is pulled deeper into the illicit
        drug trade.
